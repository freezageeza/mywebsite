            I am a born and raised cambridge boy, born at addenbrookes hospital. 
            I then moved to the outskirts of cambridge in a village called linton, 
            Which has one this iconic pub still running after all these years, called the Dog n Duck.
            I visit linton still go back to every week to play football.
            I studied a national sports diploma in college when i was 16 years old then realised a year ago that i have a passion for computers.
            In the sense that i love to be behind one constantly
